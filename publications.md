https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8613
Status:Published as Proposed Standard
2)	Group OSCORE - Secure Group Communication for CoAP
A method for protecting group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE).

Status: Accepted as IETF working group draft
3)	Group Communication for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
Usage of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for group communication, using UDP/IP multicast as the underlying data transport.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dijk-core-groupcomm-bis
Status: Individual draft, presented at IETF 106
4)	Observe Notifications as CoAP Multicast Responses
Method for a CoAP server to send (secure) observe notifications as response messages over IP multicast.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tiloca-core-observe-multicast-notifications
Status: Individual draft, presented at IETF 104, 105 and 106
5)	Discovery of OSCORE Groups with the CoRE Resource Directory
Method for a CoAP endpoint to use the CoRE Resource Directory for discovering OSCORE groups and acquiring information to join them.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tiloca-core-oscore-discovery
Status: Individual draft, presented at IETF 104, 105 and 106
6)	Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) using the OAuth 2.0 Framework (ACE-OAuth)
A framework for authentication and authorization in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, based on a set of building blocks including OAuth 2.0 and CoAP.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz
Status:IETF Last Call
7)	Additional OAuth Parameters for Authorization in Constrained Environments (ACE)
Definition of new parameters to interact with the Authorization Server of the framework for   authentication and authorization for constrained environments (ACE).
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-params
Status: IETF Last Call
8)	Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs)
With reference to authentication, authorization and access control, this document provides a description of how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT) (which is defined by RFC 8392) that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of-possession key.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession
Status:In the RFC Editorâ€™s Queue
9)	 OSCORE profile of the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments Framework
A profile for the Authentication and   Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, which  utilizes Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments   (OSCORE) in order to achieve communication security, server authentication, and proof-of-possession.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oscore-profile
Status:Publication Requested
10)	 Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Profile for Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)
A profile for the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, which utilizes Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) in order to achieve communication security, server authentication, and proof-of-possession.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-dtls-authorize
Status:Publication Requested
11)	 Key Provisioning for Group Communication using ACE
Definition of message formats and procedures for requesting  and distributing group keying material using the Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, to   protect communications among group members.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-key-groupcomm
Status: Accepted as IETF working group draft
12)	  Key Management for OSCORE Groups in ACE
A method to request and provision keying   material in group communication scenarios where the group communication is based on CoAP and secured with Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE), building on the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization

Status: Accepted as IETF working group draft
13)	 EST over secure CoAP (EST-coaps)
This document defines how to transport Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) payloads over secure CoAP (EST-coaps), which allows constrained devices to use   existing EST functionality for provisioning certificates.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-coap-est
Status: Submitted to IESG for Publication
14)	 Group OSCORE Profile of the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments Framework
A profile for the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, which  utilizes Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments   (OSCORE) and/or Group OSCORE to provide communication security   between a Client and (a group of) Resource Server(s), as well as OSCORE in order to achieve communication security, server authentication, and proof-of-possession.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tiloca-ace-group-oscore-profile
Status: Individual draft, presented at IETF 105 and 106
15)	Admin Interface for the OSCORE Group Manager
