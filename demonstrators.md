# CRITISEC Demonstrators

The CRITISEC project has implemented 5 real life demonstrators to show the capabilities of the CRITISEC solutions:

* [Energy Distribution](#energy-distribution)
* [Smart City](#smart-city)
* [Critical Communication](#critical-communication)
* [Secure End-to-end Group Communication](#secure-end-to-end-group-communication)
* [Secure and Automated Device On-boarding](#secure-and-automated-device-on-boarding)

## Critical Communication

Involved partners: HITEC (LU), Uni Lux (LU), Sensative (SE), Applio (SE), CSTI (TW)

The Critical Communication Demo shows how CRITISEC solutions can be used to secure the Communication of first responders in disaster areas.
The basis of the communication is the Nomadic Satellite Communication System, short NoSaCo. The NoSaCo is a ruggedized and easy to install box that provides Satellite connectivity to the headquarter and a WiFi and IoT network on the disaster side, when no other communication means are available.
The NoSaCo also includes a server to run different services needed for the work of the first responders.

For the security of the LoRa based  IoT network the same solutions are used that are already used in the Energy distribution and Smart Cities demo: Sensative’s Yggio 3 and Applio’s Sensec.
For the security of the whole network the DTM-Module of our Taiwanese partner CSTI is used. The DTM-module detects, tags and mitigates attacks to the communication network.
For the security of all applications running on the sever (including Yggio3 and Sensec) an innovative new concept is used in the Edge Computing Security Module (ECSM).
The ECSM analyses the logs generated by the applications running on the NoSaCo server and uses specific Artificial Intelligence models to detect anomalies in the behaviour of the applications.
To accomplish this all logs from the applications are collected in a LOGSTASH repository. Logstash is a free and open server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources, transforms it, and then sends it to an application that can be specified by the user - in this case to the ECSM.
ECSM is reading the logs, generates templates and removes noise and the analyses the log templates using a specialized AI Model.

![AI Log-based Anomaly Detection](images/demo-anomaly-detection1.JPG)

The system is trained by the normal behaviour of the applications in real-life for minimum 24 hours. It then can detect anomalies in the behaviour of the applications and alert an operator when anomalies are detected. The operator can accept the anomaly as normal and the AI model now knows that this behaviour is ok or as anomaly and start mitigation actions.
In the practical demo we will concentrate on the ECSM workflow.
The scenario is as follows:
* NoSaCo is setup in a disaster area
* A LoRa network is used to connect GPS sensors to locate First responders
* A monitoring application uses the Yggio API to collect information from sensors and to configure the sensors. The application has read and write access to the API
*	An attacker successfully attacks this application and controls it
*	The attacker tries to change the sensor configuration via the YGGIO API
*	Yggio refuses this request and creates a log entry about this activity
*	ECSM is using the flow described in figure 2 and detects an anomaly in the information flow.
*	ECSM alerts the operator, who can accept the anomaly or mark it as anomaly and start mitigation actions
