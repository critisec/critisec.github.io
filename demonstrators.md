## Critical Communication

Involved partners: HITEC (LU), Uni Lux (LU), Sensative (SE), Applio (SE), CSTI (TW)

The Critical Communication Demo shows how CRITISEC solutions can be used to secure the Communication of first responders in disaster areas.
The basis of the communication is the Nomadic Satellite Communication System, short NoSaCo. The NoSaCo is a ruggedized and easy to install box that provides Satellite connectivity to the headquarter and a WiFi and IoT network on the disaster side, when no other communication means are available.
The NoSaCo also includes a server to run different services needed for the work of the first responders.

For the security of the LoRa based  IoT network the same solutions are used that are already used in the Energy distribution and Smart Cities demo: Sensative’s Yggio 3 and Applio’s Sensec.
For the security of the whole network the DTM-Module of our Taiwanese partner CSTI is used. The DTM-module detects, tags and mitigates attacks to the communication network.
For the security of all applications running on the sever (including Yggio3 and Sensec) an innovative new concept is used in the Edge Computing Security Module (ECSM).
The ECSM analyses the logs generated by the applications running on the NoSaCo server and uses specific Artificial Intelligence models to detect anomalies in the behaviour of the applications.
To accomplish this all logs from the applications are collected in a LOGSTASH repository. Logstash is a free and open server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources, transforms it, and then sends it to an application that can be specified by the user - in this case to the ECSM.
ECSM is reading the logs, generates templates and removes noise and the analyses the log templates using a specialized AI Model.

Figure 3.2: Log-based anomaly detection process

The system is trained by the normal behaviour of the applications in real-life for minimum 24 hours. It then can detect anomalies in the behaviour of the applications and alert an operator when anomalies are detected. The operator can accept the anomaly as normal and the AI model now knows that this behaviour is ok or as anomaly and start mitigation actions.
In the practical demo we will concentrate on the ECSM workflow.
The scenario is as follows:
* NoSaCo is setup in a disaster area
* A LoRa network is used to connect GPS sensors to locate First responders
* A monitoring application uses the Yggio API to collect information from sensors and to configure the sensors. The application has read and write access to the API
*	An attacker successfully attacks this application and controls it
*	The attacker tries to change the sensor configuration via the YGGIO API
*	Yggio refuses this request and creates a log entry about this activity
*	ECSM is using the flow described in figure 2 and detects an anomaly in the information flow.
*	ECSM alerts the operator, who can accept the anomaly or mark it as anomaly and start mitigation actions

## Secure-End-to-End Group Communication

Involved partners: RISE (SE)

This demo considers the group communication model, where network nodes acting as client can send a single message to multiple recipient servers, e.g., over IP multicast. Recipients can reply back with responses over unicast. Typically, IoT-based networks and applications use the communication protocol CoAP, which natively supports such communication model.
In particular, this demo consists of an early proof-of-concept showing a number of network nodes joining a group where communication occurs also over IP multicast and is protected end-to-end with the Group OSCORE security protocol. The authorized joining process occurs through the Group Manager (GM) for the group and relies on the ACE Framework for Authentication and Authorization.

This demo leverages a number of technical security components developed during the project.

* Group OSCORE - The Group OSCORE protocol builds on the OSCORE protocol standardized in RFC 8613, and provides end-to-end protection of CoAP messages exchanged in a group communication environment. Group OSCORE fulfils the same security requirements of OSCORE, and especially provides source authentication of exchanged messages. This can be achieved in two different ways, depending on the exact mode of operation used to protect a certain message, i.e., either the “group mode” typically used for one-to-many messages or the “pairwise mode” typically used for one-to-one messages.
*	Joining of an OSCORE group with the ACE framework - The ACE Framework builds on the OAuth 2.0 framework as an access control solution for the IoT. An ACE Client obtains an Access Token from an Authorization Server (AS), as a credential proving a set of owned access rights. Then, the Client uploads the Access Token at an ACE Resource Server (RS). Finally, the Client can access resources at the RS, as allowed by the obtained Access Token.
This can be used for authorized joining of OSCORE groups. That is, a candidate group member acts as ACE Client, while the GM of the OSCORE group acts as ACE RS. By uploading the Access Token at the GM, the candidate group member proves to be authorized to join a certain OSCORE group. Then, it engages in a joining procedure with the GM, from which it obtains the keying material for operating in the OSCORE group, hence becoming a member of that group able to securely communicate with other group members using Group OSCORE.

The step forward from the current state-of-the-art and incarnated in this demo is a solution for authenticated and authorized provisioning of group key material followed by secure end-to-end group communication, with different modes of operation available to ensure good performance.
This solution is overviewed in the high-level workflow depicted in Figure 4.1. That is: i) each device obtains an authorization evidence for joining an OSCORE group, and then joins the intended OSCORE group through the associated Group Manager; ii) a group member sends secure commands to the other group members over IP multicast and protected with Group OSCORE, with responses following.

## Secure and Automated Device On-boarding

Involved partners: RISE (SE), Sony Nordic (SE), Applio (SE)

This demo considers the onboarding of IoT devices as a fundamental, early step in their lifecycle, where first crucial steps are taken to ensure that following communications are properly secured.
In particular, this demo consists of an early proof-of-concept showing how it is possible to achieve a fully automated IoT device onboarding, whose outcome includes the establishment of secure communication associations with high-level security.

As summarized below, this demo considers the standard framework for device management OMA Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M), as well as a number of technical security components.
*	OSCORE - The security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environment (OSCORE) has been standardised as RFC 8613, and provides end-to-end protection of messages exchanged by two peers using the protocol CoAP. OSCORE is especially efficient, as leveraging the standard CBOR and COSE also suitable to IoT devices. Before two peers securely communicate, they are required to establish an OSCORE Security Context.
*	LwM2M - The OMA standard LwM2M provides a control and management framework for IoT devices. An IoT device acting as LwM2M Client first “bootstraps” at a Bootstrap Server, and then “registers” at a LwM2M Server. Once completed the registration, the LwM2M Client and Server securely communicate with one another, e.g., for retrieving information from or issuing commands to the LwM2M Client. Typical communications in LwM2M rely on CoAP, and can be protected by different means, e.g., by using OSCORE. The original LwM2M bootstrapping and registration processes using OSCORE occur as depicted in Figure 5.1.

*	EDHOC - Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) is a novel, efficient key establishment protocol as well as an IETF standardisation proposal. EDHOC allows two peers to mutually authenticate and then establish a fresh secret enjoying Perfect Forward Secrecy. The main use case for EDHOC is the authenticated establishment of an OSCORE Security Context.

The step forward from the current state-of-the-art and incarnated in this demo is the integration and use of the EDHOC key establishment protocol within the LwM2M framework.
Thus, when relying on EDHOC throughout the enrolment process, an IoT device can establish OSCORE Security Contexts with other parties (notably the LwM2M Server, but also further external Application Servers), in a way which is fully automated, providing a degree of negotiation in security parameters, and ensuring high-level security properties (e.g., Perfect Forward Secrecy).
The result of such an integration is overviewed in the workflow depicted in Figure 5.3. The demo execution will practically show such a workflow throughout its steps.
